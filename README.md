### What I learned

The challenge has made me improve my skills in the layout of a component and I have started to implement the BEM methodology to my projects.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to learn how to organize the elements on the card. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
